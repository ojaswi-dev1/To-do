/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all user-specific data
 * (profiles, tasks, themes) is nested under a path corresponding to their Firebase
 * Authentication UID. This ensures that users can only ever access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is organized hierarchically under the /users/{userId} path.
 * Tasks are stored in a /tasks subcollection, and theme settings are in a /theme
 * singleton document, ensuring a clear and isolated data tree for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disallowed: Listing the top-level /users collection is
 *   explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Strict Ownership: All access to documents and subcollections under /users/{userId}
 *   is restricted to the authenticated user whose UID matches the {userId} in the path.
 * - Default Deny: Any path not explicitly defined in these rules is inaccessible.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The security model relies on path-based authorization, which is highly performant as
 * it avoids extra database reads (`get()` calls). For documents like User and Theme,
 * we enforce relational integrity by ensuring that an internal `id` or `userId` field
 * matches the `userId` in the document path upon creation and remains immutable.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data is structurally segregated by user. Each user has their own "data silo"
 * under /users/{userId}. This design naturally secures list operations, as a query
 * for a user's tasks can only be initiated on a path they already own, guaranteeing
 * that the results contain only their own documents.
